# CUDA library support for SatOS CPP application

This directory contains an example SatOS Application using CUDA Library and cpp.
This is not production-ready code, but it is useful for learning how the platform functions.

## Quickstart

In the Antaris Cloud Platform, create a TrueTwin Satellite with a remote payload and download the associated config.
Place that downloaded zip file in this directory.

Build the C++ app using the following steps:

```bash
cd examples/app-cpp

# Builds your standalone application first 
docker build -t satos-payload-example-app-cpp-cuda .
```

Next, we can run the payload application in the container. The command below assumes that `$CONFIG` is set to the name of the config file (zip) you downloaded from Antaris Cloud Platform. The file must be located in your current working directory:

```bash
CONFIG=your_remote_config_from_acp.zip

docker run --rm -e CONFIG=$CONFIG --gpus all --privileged   -v $(pwd):/workspace   -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro   -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH   -it satos-payload-example-app-cpp-cuda
```

You may now use the Antaris Cloud Platform to submit payload sequences. For example, submit a `HelloWorld` payload with
no parameters and you will see it reflected in the container logs.

The sequences supported by the example are described below:
* `HelloWorld`: takes no parameters and simply logs "hello, world from gpu with thread and block index !"
