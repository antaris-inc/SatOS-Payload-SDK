SatOS Payload Interface Reference
#################################

This reference document describes how to work with the Payload Interface, from a conceptual level down to actual API requests and responses.

Introduction
************

The Payload Interface is a bidirectional communication mechanism utilized by the Payload Controller and a Payload Application. A “channel” below represents an open connection between a single PA and the PC.

The Payload Interface relies on an asynchronous request/response model. A “correlation ID” is used to map responses back to the originating requests when async responses are to be expected. The Payload Controller also works with this asynchronous model, expecting async responses from the Payload Application to its own requests.

Though the API schema and data structures defined in this document are in syntax of programming language C, the SDK library is available in multiple languages.

Request Flow Example
********************

The following flow diagram represents how the Payload Interface is used during a typical period of payload operation:

Encryption & Authentication
***************************
Communication between a Payload Application and the Payload Controller is encrypted. All messages between the PA and PC are encrypted. This encryption feature is built into available SDK software libraries, and should be left enabled at all times.

Authentication of communication via the Payload Interface is achieved with a simple auth token retrieved during the PA registration call. This detail is handled by the SDK software libraries made available to payload developers, and no explicit action needs to be taken.

Establishing a Connection
*************************
To begin communication via the Payload Interface, PA creates a connection to the Payload Controller via the *CreateChannel* API. With the *CreateInsecureChannel* API, communication between PA and PC will not be encrypted. Once a channel is created, it is used to facilitate all other API calls.

To explicitly close the channel, a PA may use the *DeleteChannel* API. This is not required, but highly encouraged as it helps the PC understand the current state of the PA. 

Connection/channel management is typically abstracted by an SDK library, and developesr should not need to worry about explicit create/delete.

Payload Application Requests
============================

Below are the interactions that may be initiated by a Payload Application. Note that most requests define a corresponding asynchronous response, but some do not.

Register
^^^^^^^^

Register the PA with the PC, typically executed immediately after opening a channel. The PC will only communicate with PAs that successfully register themselves. After some time without registration, a PA will be considered in a bad state and may be shut down prematurely.

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``
* ``U16 HealthCheckFailAction``

  * Indicates what the PC should do if the application fails to respond to health checks five consecutive times. A ``0`` value results in no action taken, while ``1`` indicates the application should be rebooted. 


Expected async response from PC: ``ResponseRegister``

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

  * Will match what was sent in ``Register`` request

* ``U16 ReqStatus``

  * ``0`` if request succeeded, otherwise non-zero value indicating failure 

* ``[256]U8 AuthToken``


GetCurrentLocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Retrieve current GNSS (GPS) location.

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

Expected async response from PC: ``ResponseGetCurrentLocation``

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

  * Will match what was sent in request

* ``U16 ReqStatus``

  * ``0`` if request succeeded, otherwise non-zero value indicating failure 

* ``FLOAT Latitude``
* ``FLOAT Longitude``
* ``FLOAT Altitude``
* ``U64 DeterminedAt``

  * Time at which the location was determined 


PayloadPowerControl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Request to change the power state of the Payload Device. PA can power cycle its device by issuing a Power-Off request followed by a Power-On after some delay.

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``
* ``U16 PowerOperation``

  * Request Power-Off with a value of ``0``, or Power-On with a value of ``1``

Expected async response from PC: ``ResponsePayloadPowerControl``

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

  * Will match what was sent in request

* ``U16 ReqStatus``

  * ``0`` if request succeeded, otherwise non-zero value indicating failure 


StageFileDownload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Indicate that a file is ready to be download through a ground link. The Payload Application is expected to first place the file in ``/opt/antaris/outbound`` before making this API call. The Payload Controller will delete this file from the outbound folder once it is successfully downlinked.

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``
* ``char[64] FileLocation``
  
  * Relative path within ``/opt/antaris/outbound``. For example, to stage a file located at ``/opt/antaris/outbound/foo/bar.json``, one would set ``FileLocation=foo/bar.json``

Expected async response from PC: ``ResponseStageFileDownload``

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

  * Will match what was sent in request

* ``U16 ReqStatus``

  * ``0`` if request succeeded, otherwise non-zero value indicating failure. Success here does NOT mean the file has been downlinked. It simply represents the downlink request has been accepted, and the file will be downlinked at a later time.


Payload Controller Requests
===========================

Below are the interactions that may be initiated by the Payload Controller. Responses, when appropriate, are sent from the Payload Application.

StartSequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PC sends this command to the PA to instruct it to execute a known sequence immediately.

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``
* ``char[16] SequenceName``

  * An alphanumeric string that should be mapped and/or parsed by the Payload Application

* ``char[64] SequenceParams``

  * An alphanumeric string that should be mapped and/or parsed by the Payload Application

* ``U64 ScheduledDeadline``

  * Absolute unix time at which the PA must must have completed the sequence

Expected async response from PA: ``SequenceDone``

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

  * Must match what was sent in request

Shutdown
^^^^^^^^

Initiate a PA shutdown immediately. Application can shutdown its payload hardware gracefully before shutting itself down. PA will have a graceful shutdown deadline, the length of which is pre-configured in the Antaris Cloud Platform tasks.

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``
* ``U64 ShutdownDeadline``

  * Absolute unix time at which the PA must must have issued a response and shut down gracefully, otherwise more aggressive shutdown procedures may be taken

Expected async response from PA: ``ResponseShutdown``

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

  * Must match what was sent in request

* ``U16 ReqStatus``

  * ``0`` if request succeeded, otherwise non-zero value indicating failure 


HealthCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^

PC monitors PA health by calling this request periodically (every 5 seconds). The PA should be prepared to process this request and report an accurate representation of its health immediately

Parameters:

* ``U16 CorrelationId``

Expected async response from PA: ``ResponseHealthCheck``

* ``U16 AppState``

  * Indicate overall payload application health with ``0``, otherwise non-zero indicates the PA is in a bad state

* ``U16 ReqsToPCInErrCnt``

  * Number of requests from PA to PC that failed

* ``U16 RespsToPCInErrCnt``

  * Number of responses from PA to PC that failed
